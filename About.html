									<h4 style="text-align: center;">How We Started</h4>
									<p><em style="color: #1c1398">Insignia Training Partners, LLC </em>was originally launched to support an opportunity to identify and provide contract
										instructional designers for a very large ILT-to-WBT conversion project in the communication industry. Since that project, 
										led by founder Ann Debus, we have gone on to provide outstanding and talented resources, including contract instructors, instructional
										designers, and learning administration support, for other Fortune 500 organizations looking to outsource or augment their training delivery
										and development initiatives. Through client Xerox Learning Services, we provided instructors and designers to a long list of their learning 
										clients, including Hertz, Amex, Microsoft, Lilly Pharmaceutical, BP Oil, and others. 
										Insignia has also done delivery and design work for Mercedes-Benz Financial, Harvard Drug Group, Sandy Corporation, Ford Motor,
										and Consumers Energy. Now led by Bernie DeSantis, Insignia continues to have a warm and valuable consultative relationship with Ann Debus.
										</p>
